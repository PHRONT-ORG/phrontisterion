  </div>

  <p>A merchant spent his life buying trinkets that glittered from a distance. He carried receipts like trophies and called himself wealthy.</p>
  <p>One day he saw a pearl in a window—quiet, plain, and so costly the price did not fit on the tag. He felt offended by it. “Who would pay that,” he muttered, “for something that doesn’t even shine?”</p>
  <p>He went home and found that his shelves were full, but his hands were empty.</p>
  <p>So he returned to the window and asked the seller, “What makes it worth this?”</p>
  <p>The seller did not argue. He set the pearl on a cloth and poured water over it. The pearl did not brighten with noise; it brightened with truth. It reflected light it did not invent.</p>
  <p>The merchant looked at his trinkets and, for the first time, saw dust.</p>
  <p>He sold what kept him busy and bought the pearl. He did not buy it to boast. He bought it to reorganize his life around what could not rot.</p>
